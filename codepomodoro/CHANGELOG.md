[1.0.4] - 2025-09-09
Changed
The sidebar view no longer automatically re-focuses when a timer is running. This allows the timer to run in the background while you navigate to other views like the Explorer or Source Control.
Fixed
Resolved an issue where the timer view would appear blank or not load correctly if it was hidden when a session started. The view now reliably updates with the current timer status whenever it is opened.
